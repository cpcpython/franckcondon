# franckcondon
This code is aimed to Calculate Franck-Condon factors for vibronic transitions of 1D systems (eg. diatomic molecules). This Method uses Numerov algorithm to solve vibrational wavefunctions. The program takes Morse parameters for the potential energy curves for both the ground and excited state levels.
